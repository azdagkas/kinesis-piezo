Put the button images at this directory with the following names:
arrow2.png
arrow.png
stop.png
home1.jpg
back.png
open_loop.png
closed_loop.png

I have not created all of the above images and I do not have the right to redistribute the
ones that are not mine. You can find some of them at pixabay.com free for use.

The GUI works even without the images. It just uses text instead of them for the buttons.
